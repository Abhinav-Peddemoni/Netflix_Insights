# Netflix_Insights
I have performed some EDA on the Netflix dataset. Did some preprocessing and created some of the visualizations.

## Based on the analysis, here are some business insights that can be drawn:
*Content Preference:* Netflix users prefer movies over TV shows, indicating a higher demand for movies on the platform. This insight can guide content production and acquisition strategies to prioritize movie content.

*Popular Genres:* International movies and dramas, as well as comedy titles, are highly popular among the audience. Investing in content production or licensing in these genres can attract and engage a larger user base.

*Director Influence:* Some directors, such as Rajiv, Jan, Ra√∫l, Suhas, and Marcus, have gained popularity among the audience. Collaborating with these popular directors or promoting their work can help attract and retain viewers.

*Genre Popularity:* International TV shows, dramas, and TV comedies are found to be popular among the audience. Emphasizing these genres in content selection and production can enhance user engagement and satisfaction.

*Content Ratings:* The majority of the content available on Netflix is rated as TV-MA and TV-14. This indicates that the audience prefers content with mature themes or content suitable for viewers above 14 years old. Aligning content offerings with popular ratings can cater to user preferences.

*Country of Production:* United States, India, and United Kingdom are the top countries where movies are produced, while United States, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, and Canada are the top countries for TV show production. Focusing on content from these countries can cater to regional preferences and diverse audience interests.

*Release Year:* Content released between 2012-2020, especially TV shows released between 2016-2020, is highly popular. Considering the popularity of recent releases and aligning content strategies accordingly can attract more viewers.

*Content Addition Trend:* There is a noticeable drop in the number of movies added after 2019 and TV shows added after 2020. Analyzing the reasons behind this trend and adjusting content acquisition or production strategies accordingly can help maintain a diverse and up-to-date content library.

*Rating and Country:* The popularity of specific ratings varies across different countries. Tailoring content offerings based on the preferences of each country can enhance user satisfaction and engagement.
